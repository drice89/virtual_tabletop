    <p>
      Welcome to virtual tabletop, the ultimate table top board game simulator
    </p>
    <p>
      The is the game client. From here you can create and add boards, 
      edit boards, add pieces to the board, and chat with fellow players.
      To set your game up, create a board and align the grid to your desired size.
      After you have set up the board you can add pieces and begin playing. The client will not enforce rules
      for you, thats up to you. Virtual tabletop is a "sandbox" enviornment which means we give you the tools to
      create the game, and the freedom to play it how you want. This allows for any number of different 
      kinds of games to be played.
